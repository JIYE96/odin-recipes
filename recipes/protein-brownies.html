    <p>These protein brownies are super fudgy, gooey, and need just four ingredients to make! No flour, no eggs, and no butter needed, I love how they are a guilt-free dessert fix.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Almond butter</li>
        <li>Protein powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding all your ingredients into a high-speed blender or food processor. Blend the ingredients together until fully combined. If desired, add some chocolate chips. You can also mix by hand in a large mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Then, transfer the batter into a lined pan and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out ‘just’ clean. While the brownies are hot in the pan, lightly press your hand over the top to form unnatural cracky tops.  </li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan completely before drizzling with chocolate and slicing them up. </li>
    </ol>
